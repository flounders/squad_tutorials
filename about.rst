These squad tutorials are designed to fill in the blanks from the in game tutorial.
A lot of things aren't covered by the tutorial that most players learn from each
other or by trial and error. This project will hopefully get new players up to
speed. With everyone better informed we may even see more consistent close and
interesting games.
